# CRUD_Device_Driver
Providing an easily used set of functions so that an application that uses your code can easily talk to an external block storage device like a hard drive (HDD). This device already has its own pre-defined set of functions that allows communication with it. However, they are tedious to use (a common problem with hardware) and not as abstracted as programmers would prefer. Thus, we are going to translate them to mimic the standard C file commands (open, close, read, write, and seek) so that communicating to the device is easier for others. In other words, your application is acting like a driver for the HDD device.
