# CRUD_Device_Driver
Providing an easily used set of functions so that an application that uses the code can easily talk to an external block storage device like a hard drive (HDD). This device has its own pre-defined set of functions that allows communication with it. Translating them to mimic the standard C file commands (open, close, read, write, and seek) so that communicating to the device is easier for others. In other words, the application is acting like a driver for the HDD device.
